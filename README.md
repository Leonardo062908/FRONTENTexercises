# Indexa - Frontend Project

Indexa is a frontend project developed using **Angular** to demonstrate the basics of component creation, styling, and integrating components within the main application. The project is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, following the initial wireframe created in Figma.

## Features

- **Base Angular Application**:

  - Created a new Angular app using `ng new` and customized it by removing default content.
  - Added a simple `<h1>` inside a `<body>` with a gradient background for initial setup.

- **First Component - Container**:

  - Created the `container` component using:
    ```bash
    ng generate component componentes/container
    ```
  - This component represents the white container of the application, as designed in the Figma mockup.
  - Integrated the `container` component into the main app (`app.component.html`) for display on the page.

- **Gradual Learning**:
  - Experimenting with component usage and adding custom content inside the `container` component.
